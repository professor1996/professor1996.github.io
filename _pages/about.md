Rui Peng is a PhD candidate in robotics at [The Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong](https://www.mech.hku.hk/).
My current supervisor is Dr. Peng Lu, who is leading the [Adaptive Robotic Controls Lab (ArcLab)](https://arclab.hku.hk/).
My research interests include unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), continuum robot, and visual servoing.
I am doing research on aerial manipulators, and origami-inspired continuum robotic manipulators, with advanced mechanical design, kinematic modeling and feedback control. 
If we have similar research spots, please feel free to contact me~

About my leisure life, I am a basketball player and self-weight fitness trainer, for which I upload my training vlogs in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/607205349).
Also, I love music, movie, and photography.
